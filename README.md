# VR House Viewing Platform


The VR House Viewing Platform is an innovative solution that leverages virtual reality technology to revolutionize the way properties are explored and purchased. This platform caters to the needs and preferences of the younger generation, who are increasingly comfortable with virtual experiences and seek convenience and immersive interactions in their house-hunting process.



## Introduction 

We have made a VR house viewing platform. We are employing an IoT enabled smart 360 degree photo taking device to map out a room. This can be now put into the website, the frontend is designed with React JS and backend Express JS, the tech stack used is MERN. It also the frontend is integrated to Ethereum Blockchain, using EtherJS. When a promoter or house-builder signs into our website, the web can go to one of the two pages. One, where it goes to a list of properties, given the approval, whether that is approved or not. Second page, promoter can see a button to add images captured using IOT devices and along with it minimal additional details of property. Then we will use a 3D GAN to create a 3D model to be put into the VR model which can be access by Oculus Quest. Now for user when they log in they can search the location in the search bar specifying where they are buying the house. A list of housing with the current prices will be displayed. We arei nfering this value from ML model using random forest regression. If the user clicks on the property card they can also see the pricing for the next 3 years. They can then download an APK which will allowed them to view the housing a virtual 3D environment in Oculus Quest.


## Features
Immersive Virtual Reality Experience: Users can virtually walk through properties using VR headsets, providing a realistic and engaging exploration of potential homes.


Extensive Property Selection: The platform offers a wide range of properties, ensuring there is something for every buyer's preference and budget.


Accurate Pricing Predictions: Machine learning algorithms, specifically random forest regression, are used to provide accurate pricing predictions for properties based on historical data and market trends.


Secure and Transparent Transactions: The integration of the Ethereum blockchain guarantees secure and transparent transactions, enhancing trust and reliability for buyers, sellers, and promoters.

Intuitive User Interface: The frontend of the website is designed with React JS, offering a user-friendly interface that simplifies the property search and selection process.




## How to Use

1.Sign up or log in to the VR House Viewing Platform.

2.Use the search bar to enter the desired location for house-hunting.

3.Browse through the list of properties available in the specified location, along with their current prices.

4.Click on a property to view more details, including pricing predictions for the next 3 years.

5.Click on a property to view more details, including pricing predictions for the next 3 years.


  
## Technologies Used

React JS: Frontend development framework for building the user interface.

Node.js with Express JS: Backend framework for handling server-side logic and API integrations.

Ethereum Blockchain: Integration with Ether Chains for secure and transparent transactions.

IoT Enabled Smart 360 Degree Photo Taking Device: Used to capture high-quality images of properties for virtual viewing.

3D GAN (Generative Adversarial Network): Utilized to create 3D models for the virtual reality environment.

Machine Learning with Random Forest Regression: ML model used to provide accurate pricing predictions for properties.

## Unity and Blender Part 
Since Unity and Blender deals with GIT LFS for upoading we didinot risk this repos integrity for the project we created separate repos for them and we are linking them here for you to check out
